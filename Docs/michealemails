Good morning Andrew,

 

Hope you are having a nice weekend.  As promised, I have gone back through the Wizard to identify areas to modify or change…or would need modifying as a result of creating a cloud version.  I am assuming that the capabilities to create all of the pie/bar charts and calculations are all possible in the cloud version.   

With a $10,000 IP investment I feel that we should have some type of agreement.  Please advise if there are terms, conditions or clauses that you would like to add and I will have a have a first draft created.  Or I can get to you and you can review first.

 

It looks like Office 2019 is out, so I appreciate your including a colleague in the development to hopefully shorten the time period.  Please advise on next steps.

 

Thank you Andrew for your help.
